........................

The Charminar is as much the
signature of Hyderabad as the Taj
Mahal is of Agra or the Eiffel Tower
is of Paris. Mohammed Quli Qutb
Shah, the founder of Hyderabad,
built Charminar in 1591 at the centre
of the original city layout. It is said
to be built as a charm to ward off a
deadly epidemic raging at that time.
Four graceful minarets soar to a
height of 48.7 m above the ground.
Charminar has 45 prayer spaces and
a mosque in it. Visitors can view the
architectural splendour inside the
Charminar. The monument is
illuminated in the evenings and a
pedestrianisation project around the
monument is under implementation.

.......................
Mecca Masjid: A two hundred yards
southwest of the Charminar is the
Mecca Masjid, so named because the
bricks were brought from Mecca to
build the central arch. The Qutb
Shahis never finished the building of
the mosque, which was completed by
Aurangzeb in 1694.

Golconda is one of the famous forts
of India. The name originates from
the Telugu words “Golla Konda”
meaning “Shepherd’s Hill”. The origins
of the fort can be traced back to the
Yadava dynasty of Deogiri and the
Kakatiyas of Warangal. Golconda was
originally a mud fort, which passed to
the Bahmani dynasty and later to the
Qutb Shahis, who held it from 1518 to
1687 A.D. The first three Qutb Shahi
kings rebuilt Golconda, over a span of
62 years. The fort is famous for its
acoustics, palaces, ingenious water
supply system and the famous Fateh
Rahben gun, one of the cannons used
in the last siege of Golconda by
Aurangzeb, to whom the fort
ultimately fell.

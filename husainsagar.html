<br>Hussainsagar Lake
Excavated in 1562 A.D. by Hussain
Shah Wali during the time of Ibrahim
Quli Qutb Shah, the lake has a
promenade that is a busy
thoroughfare today. Boating and
water sports are a regular feature in
the Hussainsagar. One of the World’s
tallest monolithic statues of the
Buddha stands on the ‘Rock of
Gibraltar’, in the middle of the lake.
Added to all these, AP Tourism has
additional boating facilities like
speed boats, motor boats, 48 seater
launch etc. Starlit dinner on-board
and private parties also can be
arranged on the Launch.
Surroundings of Hussainsagar Lake
provide marvellous entertainment
options like NTR Gardens, Necklace
Road, Tank Bund, Prasads Multiplex,
Lumbini Park, Sanjeevaiah Park etc.,
